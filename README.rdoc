My spike side project! 

I want to find out what people are people are also tagging when they tag #portland.  I thought it might create 
some interesting data about what is trending in Portland.  What I found is that it is mostly job recruiters.

I will likely add some UI to allow you to filter based on date, and exclude some of the less interesting tags.
